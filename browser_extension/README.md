# agee

An open-source, browser-native interface shell. Hit **Cmd/Ctrl+K** or click the on-page control, type or speak, and experiment with an agent surface directly on the website you are using. The extension is a thin client for your agent gateway: the browser holds only gateway connection state, while the gateway owns model routing, provider credentials, state, and customization serving.

## Principles

- **You own it.** Open source. Not a silo — a unifying layer over the surfaces you already use.
- **Bring your own engine.** Your intelligence and your data are personal. The browser points at your self-hosted or hosted agent gateway; provider keys and subscriptions stay on that engine, not in the extension.
- **Interface first.** This is not a sidebar or a separate browser agent. It is a small, movable surface on the page that can grow into user-owned workflows.
- **Browser native.** The browser is the first surface because it is where the user's work already lives and where an extension can safely start with explicit user invocation.
- **Self-host or hosted.** Same extension package whether the engine runs on your machine or a hosted gateway; switch by changing the gateway URL/token.

## Status

MVP - a Chrome (Manifest V3) extension you can load unpacked today.

**Works now:** Cmd+K command palette · Cmd+. voice wake · Cmd+, text command bar · on-page invocation surface · optional browser-native voice dictation · a controlled localhost dev page · a developer-only reload bridge for unpacked-extension work · gateway-routed command/describe turns · runtime profile settings that read/write through the gateway · constrained browser actions on low-risk pages · per-cue progress in the overlay.

**Next:** engine-served declarative UI spec · userScripts opt-in walkthrough · richer voice mode · cross-navigation task continuity · MOA integration · hosted/self-hosted engine switching.

## Develop it (quiet by default)

Development is **headless and off-screen**. It drives **Chrome for Testing**
(from the puppeteer cache) with a throwaway profile — never your daily
Chrome/Brave — so it never opens a window, never steals focus, and never
prompts. Branded Google Chrome hard-blocks `--load-extension`; Chrome for
Testing allows it and loads the real agee service worker.

```sh
npm run dev
```

That single command:

1. Serves the demo page at `http://localhost:7777/fixtures/demo.html`.
2. Launches a headless Chrome for Testing instance that loads [extension/](extension/) and prints the stable extension id.
3. Watches [extension/](extension/) and [fixtures/](fixtures/). On every edit it reloads the real extension in the background via `chrome.runtime.reload()` (or, when the headless service worker has gone dormant, by transparently relaunching the headless instance). No window appears either way.

Options:

- `npm run dev -- --port 8080` — change the localhost port.
- `npm run dev -- --no-browser` — run just the dev server (pair with the manual visible route below).

Prerequisite: Chrome for Testing must be in the puppeteer/playwright cache. If
it is missing, install it once with `npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@stable`,
or point `AGEE_CHROME_PATH` at a Chrome for Testing binary. Throwaway profiles,
logs, and screenshots are written under `.gstack/background-qa/` (git-ignored).

## See it (explicit, opt-in only)

The default loop above is intentionally invisible. When you actually want to
*watch* the extension on screen, this manual route is the only one to use — it
is separate from the quiet flow on purpose:

1. Run `npm run configure`. This bakes the gateway URL and token into
   `extension/agee.config.json` (git-ignored), so the extension works on load
   with no Options visit. The token is read from the main machine over SSH (or
   `MOA_GATEWAY_TOKEN` in your environment) and never printed.
2. Run `npm run doctor`. It confirms the baked gateway URL/token, exercises the
   live gateway with that token, and reports whether a daily browser profile has
   agee loaded from this repo path.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → select the [extension/](extension/) folder. If agee is already listed, click its reload icon and confirm the path shown in the card is this folder. It stays installed across browser restarts.
4. Open any low-risk page (or run `npm run dev -- --no-browser` and open `http://localhost:7777/fixtures/demo.html`).
5. Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) / **Ctrl+K**, type `test`, hit Enter. A healthy gateway-backed install should render a short reply such as `Hello, Captain.` or `Hi Captain.`. If you see an error mentioning an Anthropic key, Chrome is running an old extension/service worker; reload the agee card or remove the old copy and load [extension/](extension/) again.

The duck floats and wanders the page when idle, glows while it works, and rings
(a short chime plus a ring pulse) when a turn finishes, errors, or needs you.
To override the baked defaults, use the **agee** toolbar icon → Options.

Only while developing the extension package, optionally open
`chrome-extension://<extension-id>/dev.html?server=http://localhost:7777` in
that browser to get the in-page reload bridge for this manual session. This is a
developer convenience for unpacked-extension work, not an end-user deployment or
customization path.

## Verify it

Run:

```sh
npm run doctor
npm run verify
npm run smoke
```

`doctor` is the fast operational test for the default gateway setup. It checks
that current source no longer contains the old browser-side Anthropic fallback,
confirms `extension/agee.config.json` has the live gateway URL and a token
without printing the token, posts a real authenticated turn to
`/v1/voice/turns`, and scans common Chrome/Chromium profiles for an agee install
that points at this checkout. A warning that no daily profile has agee installed
means the headless tests can pass while the browser you are looking at is still
missing or stale.

`verify` checks that the MV3 manifest parses, required files exist, required
permissions/commands are present, and the extension/harness JavaScript has valid
syntax.

`smoke` launches headless Chrome for Testing with a throwaway profile, loads the
real [extension/](extension/), and confirms the agee background **service worker**
loads with a stable id. It then drives the real background → content-script
message path (`snapshot`, `type`, `click`) against the demo page and captures a
screenshot — no window shown, no focus taken. It exercises the **real** extension;
if the resolved Chrome ever refuses `--load-extension`, smoke fails loudly rather
than falling back to a content-script harness.

## Verify the gateway round-trip

The overlay does not talk to the model vendor directly. It talks to **your**
agent gateway. `smoke:gateway` proves that path
end to end, headless and off-screen (same quiet rules as `smoke`):

```sh
npm run smoke:gateway                        # health + loud-error legs
AGEE_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<token> npm run smoke:gateway   # + authenticated legs
```

It loads the real extension, writes the gateway URL + token into
`chrome.storage.local` (exactly as the Options page does), opens the overlay, and
drives real `run` / `describe` submits while a `fetch` recorder in the service
worker observes which gateway path produced each rendered reply. The default
gateway is the live one (`http://10.147.17.10:8788`); override with
`AGEE_GATEWAY_URL`.

**Confirmed round-trip sequence (what the smoke asserts):**

1. **Health** — with the URL configured, `GET /health` returns `200 {ok:true}`
   (no token needed). This is the reachability gate.
2. **Command** — a command submitted in the overlay is sent as `run` →
   `background.js` `POST /v1/voice/turns` (with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
   → the gateway's `display`/`text` reply renders as a **done** row in the
   overlay. The recorder confirms the reply originated from `/v1/voice/turns`.
3. **Describe** — "describe page" is sent as `describe` → `POST /v1/chat` → the
   gateway's `text` renders as a **done** row. The recorder confirms it
   originated from `/v1/chat`.
4. **Loud failure** — pointed at the gateway with **no/invalid token**, the same
   command hits `POST /v1/voice/turns`, the gateway returns `401`, and the
   overlay renders a clear **error** row ("Gateway rejected the token (401).
   Open agee Options and set a valid Gateway token, then Save.") with a red
   status dot. The failure is visible, never silent.

The bearer token is read **only** from `AGEE_GATEWAY_TOKEN` at run time (never
from a file, never printed — see [.env.example](.env.example)). Without it, legs
1–2 above are skipped (implemented, awaiting the token) while the **health** and
**loud-error** legs always run; the smoke does not fail just because the token is
absent.

## How it fits together

- [extension/manifest.json](extension/manifest.json) — MV3 manifest, no build step.
- [extension/content.js](extension/content.js) — the Cmd+K overlay, page perception, and action execution (the only part touching the DOM).
- [extension/background.js](extension/background.js) — routes turns to the configured gateway, captures screenshots, validates brokered page actions, and handles extension commands.
- [extension/options.html](extension/options.html) / [options.js](extension/options.js) — gateway URL/token and runtime profile settings that read/write through gateway profile endpoints.
- [extension/dev.html](extension/dev.html) / [dev.js](extension/dev.js) — developer-only in-page reload bridge for the manual visible dev session.
- [scripts/chrome-for-testing.mjs](scripts/chrome-for-testing.mjs) — resolves the headless Chrome for Testing binary and the quiet launch flags shared by the dev loop and smoke.

Model/provider calls live on the gateway, not in the page or extension service
worker, so provider credentials and subscriptions stay off the browser.
